								  <p><strong><u>Pan Pacific Hotel			(2019 - 2020)</u></strong></p>
                                  
<p>It's a honoured to be interning at Pan Pacific Hotel a wholly owned luxury hotel as a Poolside Bar trainee for 6 months. Working in Poolside Bar is never easy as you think it is, that is because I am working under the hot sun at an outdoor area, everyday I have to sweat and there isn't a day I don't sweat, the weather can be extremely hot and can be extremely cold too in anytime of the day. However, that is not going to stop me from working, whether rain or shine, as long as there's guests I will still continue to serve and entertain them.</p>
<p>Working as a team of 4, we are highly-trained to multi-task everything as much as possible, instead of doing it one by one. As most of the time our busy period is unpredictable because it really depends on the numbers of guests at the poolside thus we are always prepared and ready when the busy period begins. We also take pride in our work seriously by improving our teamwork, communication, efficiency and responsibility day by day. Most importantly, we treat and respect one another just like our own family, despite how busy it is, we are always constantly reminding each other to drink water.     </p>	                                  
<p>This internship has taught me how to fight physically, emotionally and spiritually no matter how hard it gets, I am able to survive and sacrifice whatâ€™s important to me. The things that I learnt in school is totally different when I step into the working life at Pan Pacific Hotel. Although, there are many ups and downs during work, I feel blessed to work with my colleagues in poolside bar, we suffered together, we worked together, we eat together, this creates a huge memory and experience to me as I am going to remember this 6-month journey in Pan Pacific Hotel. After successfully completing my internship, I chose to stay and continue as an In-house part-timer, one reason is because I couldn't bear to leave and another reason is because they are short of manpower. Unfortunately, because of covid-19 I was asked to leave in Feb as they doesn't need anymore part-timers in the hotel.    </p>

<p><strong><u>Eighteen chefs			(2017 - 2019)</u></strong></p> 
<p>18chefs was one of my very first job as a part-time service crew, it was actually introduced by a course that I enroll in which is At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy. After completion of all my modules in that course, I was required to work there for 1 month as an agreement in our partnership contract. Thereafter, I continue and continue working without knowing that i work for more than a year already. I was studying and working at the same time without having any diffculties in managing my time, thus, I was still able to cope with my studies well in school.  </p>
