												<h3>Institute of Technical Education College West (Higher Nitec, Ongoing)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Currently studying Higher Nitec in Hospitality Operations in my last year as I graduated Food & Beverage Operations that meets the requirements of the 1 year programme. During this time, it's extremely crucial for us to focus on our studies as we only have 6 months in school thereafter it will be our internship attachment, what make it worse is that everything is collasped together due to covid-19, and we wasn't able to practice hands on practical in school. But despite all of that, I will put in extra work harder than the rest as I do not want to be an average scorer anymore. Therefore, I will continue to push on to get a good GPA to the Polytechnic that I wish to go.  </p>

												<h3>Institute of Technical Education (Nitec, 2018 - 2020)</h3>

											<p>When I graduated from Secondary School, I entered ITE. I applied for Nitec in Food & Beverage Operations. Everything I learnt in ITE is totally different from Secondary school, it's more on practical hands on that I will use in the working environment. 1 year 6 months in school and the other 6 months is internship attachment. I did not attend any CCA as I was doing a part-time job.</p>

												<h3>NorthLand Secondary School (2014 - 2017)</h3>

											<p>Secondary School was a pretty challenging period for me. I participated Basketball for my CCA and was choosen to play for the school team throughout my 4 years in Secondary School. I participated in various events and activities that was organized by the school such as helping the old folks. N level exam was doable for me, but it wasn't that great to brag about. I was awarded with an Edusave Good Progress Award from the MOE.  </p>

												<h3>Yishun Primary School (2008 - 2013)</h3>

											<p>As a little boy, I didn't take my studies seriously, I was quite a playful boy. All I know was to play around and have fun with my friends. Eventually, my PSLE result led me to the Normal Academic stream as all my grades are just above average, wasn't the score I want to achieve. </p>
